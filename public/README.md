# Implementation Notes

## Liquid UI Implementation

This project has been updated with a "liquid" aesthetic featuring soft-glass surfaces, subtle blur, reflective highlights, and refractive layers.

### Required Actions

1. **Create or download a noise.png texture**
   - A noise.png texture is required for the subtle grain effect
   - Place it in the public directory
   - This texture is referenced in the CSS: `background: url("/noise.png");`
   - You can generate a subtle noise texture using tools like Photoshop or download one from resources like [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/)

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Update Tailwind config & base CSS
- [x] Convert cards, nav, footer, and modals to glass components
- [x] Apply reflection utility to hero illustration / key images
- [x] Add refracted hover states for primary/secondary buttons
- [x] Introduce ripple background under hero section
- [x] Ensure accessibility (text opacity â‰¥ 80% over blurred backgrounds)

## Performance Considerations

- For browsers without `backdrop-filter`, Tailwind's `supports-[backdrop-filter]:` keeps solid color
- Consider lazy-loading heavy blur sections using dynamic imports or IntersectionObserver
